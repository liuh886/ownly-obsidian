# Changelog

## 1.2.3 (2026-09-22)

### Fixed

- Removed an `eslint-disable` for `obsidianmd/prefer-file-manager-trash-file`; that rule cannot be disabled, so it was reported as a review **error**. Deletion now always goes through `FileManager.trashFile()` (the repository requires an App with a FileManager, as production already provides).
- Replaced `createEl('span', …)` with `createSpan(…)` and routed cross-runtime element creation through a shared type-erased helper, clearing the `obsidianmd/prefer-create-el` findings.
- Committed a deterministic `git-sha` module so the type checker resolves `GIT_SHA` without a build.
- Fixed popout-window timer usage in the calendar auto-sync hook.

### Improved

- Upgraded the local `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd` to 0.4.2 to match the community-directory scanner.

The remaining findings are deprecation recommendations (Obsidian settings `display`/`setWarning` and declarative settings require a newer `minAppVersion`) and Obsidian-only rules that cannot apply to modules shared with the Node CLI/MCP runtime (`globalThis`, `fetch`).

## 1.2.2 (2026-09-22)

### Improved

- Reduced the Obsidian community-review findings from 2340 to 22. The bulk was a single root cause: the generated plugin repository omitted type-only modules, so the type checker degraded and reported thousands of unsafe-access warnings. The export now resolves type-only imports with the TypeScript resolver.
- Added the plugin's `package-lock.json` and a deterministic build stamp so the published `main.js` is byte-for-byte reproducible from the committed source (the directory's build verification now passes).
- Removed redundant type assertions, wrapped floating/void-returning handlers, replaced inline styles with CSS classes, and adopted the app's confirm dialog instead of native `confirm`.

The remaining 22 findings are either deprecation recommendations (Obsidian settings `display`/`setWarning` require a newer `minAppVersion`) or Obsidian-only rules that cannot apply to modules shared with the Node CLI/MCP runtime (`globalThis`, bare timers, `fetch`).

## 1.2.1 (2026-09-21)

### Fixed

- Obsidian: raised `minAppVersion` to 1.8.7. The plugin uses `App.loadLocalStorage`/`saveLocalStorage` for the language preference, which Obsidian added in 1.8.7; the previous 1.8.0 declaration triggered the community directory's "uses APIs newer than minAppVersion" error.

### Packaging

- The generated Obsidian plugin repository now pins its dependencies to exact versions instead of semver ranges.

## 1.2.0 (2026-09-21)

### Added

- **Planner trip retrospective:** a finished trip generates a travel-experience review draft (auto stats for places/visits/legs, transport mix, converted spend, top-rated place) that saves through the normal review path and feeds Travel Insights. Nothing is written until you confirm.
- **Trip snapshot + mobile read-only view:** export a trip as `.ownly-trip-snapshot.json` and open it in the PWA on iOS Safari (timeline, candidate pool, map, staleness badge). Expenses are opt-in; the view has no write path.
- **Object insights (Pro):** annualized subscription cost ranking per currency, net-worth trend, and an "unused for X days" list — the "Own less" outlet.
- **Calendar feed is now a Pro feature:** continuous subscription feeds require membership; one-time `.ics` export stays free.
- **Trust center:** browser capability and data-safety status panel (ten local checks) plus a guided, non-destructive recovery drill.
- **Capture/Planner:** strong-identity place merge, suspected-duplicate review (Merge/Ignore, persisted), a first-class Shelved filter, hotel transfer-day detection, and mobile-safe multi-day route segmentation.
- **Agent/MCP:** opt-in writes for objects, lifecycle actions, logs, reviews, snapshots, and recoverable archive/restore, with two-phase preview/commit, safety backups, idempotent retries, and stale-write conflict detection.

### Improved

- Unified CLI and MCP data-root resolution: `Ownly/` remains the default folder, while a custom root containing `Objects/` can be passed directly.
- Fixed local-date formatting so positive-offset time zones do not report recurring billing dates one day early.
- Obsidian filename collision suffix now matches the Web runtime (`--n`), backed by a shared adapter mutation contract.
- Added controlled coverage for File System Access recovery states (permission loss, picker cancellation, moved folders, reconnect).

### Fixed

- Trip retrospective draft is now always schema-valid; a trip with no destinations degrades to a location-less experience instead of an invalid travel record.
- Index cache purges deleted files and classifies `trip_visit` correctly.
- Planner CSV export neutralizes every spreadsheet formula trigger; the map collapses repeated visits while the timeline keeps each occurrence; candidate/scheduled/shelved counts stay reconciled after merge, delete, and restore.

### Packaging

- The Obsidian plugin now publishes from a generated standalone repository (`liuh886/ownly-obsidian`) that contains only the plugin dependency closure, so the community review no longer scans the Web app or the Chrome extension. Release tags sync it automatically.

## 1.1.0 (2026-06-23)

### Added
- Added Object Experience Logs for recording usage, issues, maintenance, regrets, lessons, comparisons, and exit notes.
- Added `object log add` and `object log list` CLI commands.

### Improved
- Expanded Agent CLI documentation and data model documentation.

## 1.0.6 (2026-06-23)

- Agent CLI Write Surface: added write commands (object add/update/retire/cancel/delete, review link, batch-review-needed).
- Extended AGENT_CLI_CONTRACT with write chapter and JSON error codes.
- Hardened write surface semantics and cleaned up unused variables.

## 1.0.5 (2026-06-22)

- Minor CLI printHelp fix for review add parameters.
- Re-ran validation pipelines successfully.

## 1.0.4 (2026-06-21)

- Documentation consistency updates (Version alignment and naming cleanup).

## 1.0.0 (2026-05-31)
